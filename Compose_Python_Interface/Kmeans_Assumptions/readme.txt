		Demonstration of k-means assumptions
		====================================

This example is meant to illustrate situations where k-means will produce
unintuitive and possibly unexpected clusters. In the first three plots, the
input data does not conform to some implicit assumption that k-means makes and
undesirable clusters are produced as a result. In the last plot, k-means
returns intuitive clusters despite unevenly sized blobs.
